            Hello and welcome on Pandapp website !<br><br>
        </h1>
        <p>
            If you are here, it is probably because you have downloaded and tested our application.<br>
            And for that, thank you very much.<br><br>
            This application is our IT bachelor degree final project at the Université de Franche-Comté, Besançon, France.<br>
            Under the supervision of our teachers Mrs. Felea and Mr. Merlet.<br><br>
            For now, please let us let us introduce our dev team (which is obviously the best team that could ever exist).<br><br>
            On the photograph below you can find on the far left, the one who developed the smartphone application.<br>
            I named: Laura Bobillier!<br><br>
            On this same photo, on the far right, you can find the man who coded the server that allows communication between the computer and the smartphone.<br>
            I named: Florian Jeandenans!<br><br>
            And finally the person in the middle of this same photo, the one who developed the pc application. <br>
            I named: Maxime Caron!!<br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <br>
            We are very proud of the result even if we would have enjoyed to do even more.
            <br>
            Let's make it sure, we plan to add more features over time !
            <br>
            Because beyond the role of developers of the application, we are also fervent users.
            <br><br>
            Finally, we would like to thank all the people who were able to support and help us :<br>
            Firstly, our teachers who kindly agreed to supervise our project,<br>
            but also all these benevolent people on Stackoverflow
            <br>
            as well as all the Indians on Youtube for their precious help !!
            <br><br>
